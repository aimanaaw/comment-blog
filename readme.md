# comment-blog

This is a comment blog that uses:

React in the front end (Semantic-UI)
Socketio for real-time updates
Flask in the back end
Database: PostgreSQL

Install the pip packages in the requirements.txt and the npm packages in package.js
Go into the flask-server folder and run <python run.py>. Your server should begin running on port 5000
Go into the react-client folder and run <npm start>. Your client server should begin running on port 3000

You can ignore the docker files because they are incomplete as I am trying to dockerize the app.
